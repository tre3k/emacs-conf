# My emacs config

### Install:

``` git clone https://github.com/tre3k/emacs-conf/ ~/.emacs.d ```

``` cd ~/.emacs.d ```

and run: ```./setup.sh init```

This file clone some packages also as "el-get", "auto-complete", etc. And generate ~/.emacs.d/packages/packages.el file with the list with packages. See "setup.sh". 
This file also install Victor Mono Font (https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) to ~/.fonts, just I like this font.

Next step just run emacs. el-get install other packages (now magit).
